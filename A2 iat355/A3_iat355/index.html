      <p>
        Based on these findings from the dataset, most games sold modestly while some dominated total revenue.
        Historically, action genres have been the most successful category and it showed. Besides that,
        the peak in 2008 could suggest that there was a huge leap in console technology during that period.
      </p>

      <!-- Visualization 1A -->
      <h2>Visualization 1A: Which platforms have the highest total global sales across all games?</h2>
      <div id="view1a"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection for Visualization 1A:</strong>
        PS2 tops the total global sales, followed by X360, PS3, Wii, and Ds. This could suggest that
        platforms with large install bases and long lifespans accumulate more sales.
      </p>

     <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong> 
        A horizontal bar chart is one of the clearest ways to compare totals across categories. 
        Since platforms are nominal categories, bars allow easy visual comparison of length to 
        represent magnitude. Sorting the bars in descending order highlights which platforms
        dominate global sales immediately. Using a horizontal layout improves readability because
        platform names are easier to read on the y-axis than rotated vertically.
      
      </p>

      <!-- Visualization 1B -->
      <h2>Visualization 1B: For the top-selling platforms, which genres contribute the most to total global sales?</h2>
      <div id="view1b"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection for Visualization 1B:</strong>
        Action and Sports tend to appear strongly across multiple major platforms, indicating broad cross-platform
        appeal. The pairings with darker cells suggest that certain genres are especially successful on specific consoles.
    
      </p>

      <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong> 
        I selected a heatmap because it allows two categorical variables (platform and genre) 
        to be compared simultaneously while encoding sales magnitude through color intensity. 
        This makes it easier to spot strong platform and genre combinations without scanning 
        multiple separate charts. The color gradient was chosen to emphasize higher sales with
        darker tones, making patterns stand out visually. A heatmap is especially effective when 
        exploring relationships between two categorical dimensions.
      
      </p>


      <!-- Visualization 2A -->
      <h2>Visualization 2A: How have total global video game sales changed over time?</h2>
      <div id="view2a"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection for Visualization 2A:</strong>
        Global sales rose sharply from the mid-1990s, peaked around the late 2000s, then declined after the early 2010s.
        New consoles being introduced could be the cause of this pattern.
      </p>

       <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong> 
        A line chart was used because the primary variable of interest (year) is temporal. Line charts effectively 
        show trends and changes over time, making the rise and decline of global sales clearly visible. The continuous 
        line emphasizes the overall trajectory of the gaming industry, especially the rapid growth 
        and eventual decline after the peak. This format makes it easy to identify turning points 
        such as the late 2000s peak.
      
      </p>

      <!-- Visualization 2B -->
      <h2>Visualization 2B: How do sales over time differ for the top platforms, and when did each platform peak?</h2>
      <div id="view2b"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection for Visualization 2B:</strong>
        Each platform shows a distinct lifespan curve, rising to a peak then dropping off, which matches how consoles gain
        and lose popularity over time. The peaks for Wii/DS cluster around the late 2000s, while other platforms peak slightly
        earlier or later. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong> 
        To compare multiple platforms over time, I used a multi-line chart. This allows each platform’s sales trend to be displayed simultaneously 
        while maintaining clarity through color differentiation. This design makes it easy to observe lifecycle patterns where each platform rises 
        to a peak and then declines. Using separate colored lines helps show competition and overlap between platforms during similar time periods.
      
      </p>

      <!-- Visualization 3A -->
      <h2>Visualization 3A: How do total sales differ across regions (NA, EU, JP, and Other) for the top platforms?</h2>
      <div id="view3a"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection for Visualization 3A:</strong>
        North America and Europe contribute the largest shares for most top platforms, while Japan contributes a smaller portion
        overall except for certain consoles. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong> 
        I chose a stacked bar chart because it effectively shows how regional sales contribute to each platform’s total sales. 
        The stacked format allows viewers to see both the overall magnitude and the proportional contribution of each region at 
        the same time. Using color to differentiate regions improves clarity and comparison across platforms. This design makes 
        it easier to understand how global success is distributed geographically.
      
      </p>

      <!-- Visualization 3B -->
      <h2>Visualization 3B: Which platforms are more popular in North America vs Japan?</h2>
      <div id="view3b"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection for Visualization 3B:</strong>
        The ranking differs noticeable between regions where some platforms perform strongly in North America but not as strongly
        in Japan, and vice versa. This could be the result of differences in available game options or cultural gaming tastes.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong> 
        I used faceted bar charts to compare two regions side-by-side. Instead of stacking or overlaying, faceting keeps the regions visually 
        separated, reducing clutter and making differences clearer. This design choice allows viewers to directly compare platform rankings 
        across regions without confusion. It highlights how popularity shifts depending on location.
      
      </p>

      <!-- Visualization 4A -->
      <h2>Visualization 4A: Which genres sell the most in Japan compared to North America?</h2>
      <div id="view4a"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection for Visualization 4A:</strong>
        Genre popularity differs by region where Japan shows a strong preference for Role–Playing compared to North America,
        where they love Action and Sports with much higher totals.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong> 
        For this comparison, I again used faceted bar charts to clearly contrast genre preferences across two regions. 
        This layout emphasizes differences in ranking rather than overall totals alone. Bar charts 
        are appropriate here because genre is categorical and the goal is to compare magnitudes.
      
      </p>

      <!-- Visualization 4B -->
      <h2>Visualization 4B: Are there genres that are much stronger in one region than the other (Japan vs North America)?</h2>
      <div id="view4b"></div>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection for Visualization 4B:</strong>
        There are some points that are far from the rest which can indicate genres that are much stronger in one region than the other.
        Role-Playing sits noticeably higher compared to North America’s total on the same genre, which shows Japan’s stronger preference
        for that genre. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>Design Choice:</strong> 
        A scatterplot was selected to show the relationship between two quantitative variables simultaneously 
        (total NA sales and total JP sales per genre). Unlike bar charts, this format reveals relative balance 
        or imbalance between regions. Points that fall far from the diagonal indicate genres that are disproportionately 
        stronger in one region. The scatterplot allows quick identification of outliers, such as Role-Playing being stronger 
        in Japan relative to North America.
